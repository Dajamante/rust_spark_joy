Does Rust SPARK joy?

This is my notes taking for my thesis.

This repo is an [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html).

Install `mdbook` with `cargo` or download an executable from their [Github releases page](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases).

Then run inside the repository (if you have the exectuable)
`./mdbook serve --open` or `mdbook serve --open` if you downloaded `mdbook` with Rust and `cargo`.
